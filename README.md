# 01-HTML-CSS-and-Git-Code-Refactor
For my first homework assignment, I have been given a code that I have refactored to eliminate any redundancies in the code as well to be a good way for me to practice utilizing the many tools that I have learned so far in my class. Something important to mention, I have also included alternative texts and titles for images for anyone with handicaps or disabilities so that way they may be provided with more access to this website.

The overall functionality of the website is now much better, you can now click on links on the navbar and be taken to its corresponding spot on the website. There was a lot of condensing of the code to eliminate any excess redundancies. It was refactored to make it as efficient and logical as I could make it.
